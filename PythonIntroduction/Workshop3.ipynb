    "### What are Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that we are able to call multiple times after defining in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are very useful and allow us to write blocks of code that we can call on later. This helps us to reduce the amount of times we need to write the same code and also help with maintaining code. This is as we only need to change the function if something changes. Where as without functions we would need to change all the code in all spots where that functionality appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions also allow us to pass data into them in the form of parameters and return data from the functions through their return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a function the keyword \"def\" is used. This allows us to define a function. A function needs a name and may have input parameters. We would write a simple function that takes no inputs as seen below.\n",

    "A more common example is through abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is on that is never instantiated but is used for inheritence. For example now we don't create a shape object only square and triangle objects. An example of an interface is an object that only contains methods but these methods have no implementation, hence this can be used to inherit from and overwrite those methods. This allows us to know that objects that inherit from it will use these methods hence we can use polymorphism and call those methods where all we need to know is that it inherits from that interface.
